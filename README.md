Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

It comes with a **Professional Sample Page**, so you can see how your projects and skills would look live.

- Hero section + call-to-action button  
- Projects grid with images and descriptions  
- About section to introduce yourself  
- Contact form with direct email link  
- Smooth animations on project cards  

## ðŸš€ How I Use It

1. Upload `nextgen-portfolio` to `wp-content/themes/` on WordPress  
2. Activate the theme from **Dashboard â†’ Appearance â†’ Themes**  
3. Create a new page and choose **Professional Sample Page** template  
4. Add your own images in `assets/images/`  
5. Publish and enjoy your portfolio! ðŸŽ‰
